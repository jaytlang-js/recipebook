    <h1>Oatmeal, done simply</h1>

        Possibly the easiest, hardest-to-mess up oatmeal recipe you can imagine. Maybe 
        there would be value in me trying to add some depth to this? But simple is better.
        If I had to provide any further comment, I'd say -- if you're me, go easy on the
        water. It's all about the ratios, and I'd rather have oatmeal which is a little
        tough than a soggy soupy mess.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1/2 cup of instant oats. The nutritional value of these is supposedly
            identical to the tougher, more "raw" oat varieties.
        </li>
        <li>A reasonable amount of water -- you'll need a cup after boiling</li>
        <li>1 heaping tablespoon of cinnamon; more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Optional:</strong>
            1 granny smith apple, sliced and dipped into 1/4 cup peanut butter
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add water to pan, sprinkling in a pinch of salt to taste.
            Bring to a rolling boil.
        </li>
        <li>While the water is heating up, mix cinnamon and oats in a bowl.</li>
        <li>
            If serving with apples, cut the apples and apportion the peanut butter between 
            each slice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once water finishes boiling, measure out 1 scant cup from the pan
            and pour into your oatmeal. Stir thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let stand for 2 minutes until water is not visible or the oats look
            sufficiently puffy.
        </li>
    </ol>
