# Recipe Book :bento:

An extremely simple website which showcases a collection of recipes I more or less live on. Incidentally, my first foray into web development as well. Built with basic HTML -- that's

- Lists, ordered and otherwise
- Links
- Images
- Correct semantic tags for all of the text

...*all without any styling or JavaScript*. How boring!

## Status :construction:

This website is under construction, and probably will be for a while! I'm planning to add as many recipes as I can which are relevant to my day-to-day. Here's what we have so far.
